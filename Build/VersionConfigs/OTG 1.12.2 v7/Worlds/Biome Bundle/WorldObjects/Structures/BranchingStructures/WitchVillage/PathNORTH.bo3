# Require a condition at a certain location in order for the BO3 to be spawned.
# BlockCheck(x,y,z,BlockName[,BlockName[,...]]) - one of the blocks must be at the location
# BlockCheckNot(x,y,z,BlockName[,BlockName[,...]]) - all the blocks must not be at the location
# LightCheck(x,y,z,minLightLevel,maxLightLevel) - light must be between min and max (inclusive)

# You can use "Solid" as a BlockName for matching all solid blocks or "All" to match all blocks that aren't air.

# Examples:
#   BlockCheck(0,-1,0,GRASS,DIRT)  Require grass or dirt just below the object
#   BlockCheck(0,-1,0,Solid)       Require any solid block just below the object
#   BlockCheck(0,-1,0,WOOL)        Require any type of wool just below the object
#   BlockCheck(0,-1,0,WOOL:0)      Require white wool just below the object
#   BlockCheckNot(0,0,0,WOOL:0)   Require that there is no white wool below the object
#   LightCheck(0,0,0,0,1)          Require almost complete darkness just below the object

# Branches are objects that will spawn when this object spawns when it is used in
# the CustomStructure resource. Branches can also have branches, making complex
# structures possible. See the wiki for more details.

# Regular Branches spawn each branch with an independent chance of spawning.
# Branch(x,y,z,branchName,rotation,chance[,anotherBranchName,rotation,chance[,...]][IndividualChance])
# branchName - name of the object to spawn.
# rotation - NORTH, SOUTH, EAST or WEST.
# IndividualChance - The chance each branch has to spawn, assumed to be 100 when left blank

# Weighted Branches spawn branches with a dependent chance of spawning.
# WBR(x,y,z,branchName,rotation,chance[,anotherBranchName,rotation,chance[,...]][MaxChanceOutOf])
# MaxChanceOutOf - The chance all branches have to spawn out of, assumed to be 100 when left blank
